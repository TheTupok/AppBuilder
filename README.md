# AppBuilder

Applications can add, resize, and remove components. You can add components by selecting the desired template and dragging it to the workspace

#How to start

npm install, npm start. Open browser url http://localhost:4200

# Resize components

at each corner there are elements that make it possible to increase the component

# Render new elements

New elements are created through the angular - Renderer2 library. Also, new components receive standard classes and an event listener for further work.

# Ability to add elements to a container

By creating a container, you can place other objects in it. They will be attached to this container, and when the container is moved, all components inside will also move. Components can be detached from the container by simply pulling it out
